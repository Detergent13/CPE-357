1) For sizeof(numbers)- in this scope, the compiler knows the number of
elements in the array. Thus, it will take sizeof(int) and multiply that
by 5 (the number of elements), resulting in 20. I just treated it like an
int *.

2) Full credit

3) Linker will throw a fit over not finding an extern, not compiler.

4) Full credit

5) I just neeeded to catch s being NULL, and return NULL in that case.

6) Just messed up my recursive thinking a bit. Need to set list->next
to the function call, then return.
