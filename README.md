# CPE 357 (Systems Programming) @ Cal Poly SLO
## Dr. Phillip Nico - Spring Quarter 2022

## Disclaimer:
Please, for the love of God, don't just copy my code if you're in the course right now. Seriously, it will do you no favours. If you get caught, you're in for a world of pain. But even if you get away with it, you're just screwing yourself. Copying my (often broken, btw) code will mean you don't actually understand all of the stuff going on in this course. And that will absolutely come back to bite you on the midterms and final exam. Seriously, just don't. If you're in this class, you're probably an awfully smart person. Use your brain, and ask classmates, the professor, Piazza, etc. These are all invaluable resources that helped me immensely throughout this course. You've been warned, please be intelligent. Follow the syllabus and the academic honesty policy.  

## Contents:  
This is all of my coursework for Systems Programming, a.k.a. the reaper of CSC/CPE. I finished the quarter with an A-, which I'm really pleased with :)  
It includes all of my source code, a couple custom libraries from Dr. Nico that I migrated over, my grades/feedback for every assignment, and the spec sheets.  

## Goal:
My hope in sharing this is that I can help people get a feel for the course, get past roadblocks, and hopefully appreciate the code that I'm proud of.

## My Thoughts on the Course:
It's hard. No way around that. You will be working a ton on these assignments. But Dr. Nico is an incredible professor who makes it extremely entertaining, comprehensible, and rewarding. I have an immense amount of respect for him and highly recommend taking it with him if you have the pleasure. The class is very much a dedication and skill check though; if you've BSed your way through your major until now, this is probably where it's going to catch up to you. Put in the effort, don't take easy outs like cheating, skipping lectures, barely scraping by, etc. People definitely get weeded out. Oh, and *actually* study for the midterms. Properly. *Totally* not speaking from experience or anything. Give your best and don't let yourself fall behind! It's an extremely rewarding and cool class.
