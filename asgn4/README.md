This was a collaborative assignment, and thus is already on GitHub in a seperate repository.  

You can find its source code [here](https://github.com/Detergent13/mytar).  

It's been a bit, but if I remember correctly I wrote list and extract, whereas Minh wrote create. The utility functions and boilerplate were roughly 50/50.  

Shoutout to my wonderful partner! I think we made a great team and developed a project I'm still proud of to this day.
